# Titanic
Download, explore, and wrangle the Titanic passenger manifest dataset with an eye toward developing a predictive model for survival.

This tutorial is based on the Kaggle Competition,["Predicting Survival Aboard the Titanic"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## STEP ONE: EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
_(You will do this portion in the Data Wrangling course.)_
### Things to think about
1. How to explore a new dataset?
2. What to look for in tabular data?
3. What visualization tools can you use to help you explore?
4. What is the end goal of data wrangling? Why are we even doing this?
5. What to clean and how to clean it?
