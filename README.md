# Titanic
Download, explore, and wrangle the Titanic passenger manifest dataset with an eye toward developing a predictive model for survival.

This tutorial is based on the Kaggle Competition,["Predicting Survival Aboard the Titanic"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## STEP ONE: EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
Start by cloning this repository.

__Anaconda users__: you should have everything you need, but _if_ you find you are missing anything, type this into the command line (replace <package> with whatever package you want to install):

    conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/blaze <package>

__Others__: make sure the required libraries are installed by using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt    

Then look inside the data folder and open ```train.csv``` to check out the dataset we'll be exploring today.  

To start the lab, open up the iPython Notebook file: ```titanic_wrangling.ipynb```.


### Things to think about
1. How to explore a new dataset?
2. What to look for in tabular data?
3. What visualization tools can you use to help you explore?
4. What is the end goal of data wrangling? Why are we even doing this?
5. What to clean and how to clean it?
